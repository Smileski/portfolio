            <h3>Why Do People Love Chocolate?</h3>
            <p class="padding"> It is estimated that currently 1 billion people eat chocolate every day. In 2020 alone, some chocolate brands saw triple digit growth online during the pandemic. In America, the average person eats about 12 pounds of chocolate per year, compared to 15 pounds for the average European. It’s also interesting to know that 43% of online shoppers stick to their favorite brands again and again & 49% of online chocolate purchasers want to know more about how their chocolate was sourced according to one Wool & Water Report. One must begin to wonder, then, why do so many people seem to love chocolate that much--aside from the super great taste, that is!
So, what exactly makes chocolate so special?
Well, for starters, because it is derived from a naturally occurring plant, chocolate is known to have some rather medicinal properties. According to science, eating chocolate not only tastes good but it can actually make you happy.
We don’t need an excuse to reach for a piece of the sweet treat. Sampling the local chocolate is part of the travel experience! Here are seven countries that make the best chocolate.

              <h3>Belgium</h3>
              <p class="padding"> You can’t go to Belgium and not go to a chocolate shop – there are more than 2,000 throughout the country! What makes Belgian chocolate unique is that it is only cooled at the end of the production process, which allows it to hold onto more of its aroma. Belgian chocolate is also almost entirely handcrafted. These two factors do make Belgian chocolate a little more expensive, but as they say – treat yourself!

                <h3>Switzerland</h3>
                <p class="padding"> Even if you haven’t been to Switzerland, you’ve probably had Swiss chocolate. Lindt is the most popular Swiss chocolate brand, and can be purchased around the world. What’s especially interesting about the production of Swiss chocolate is that although Switzerland’s climate isn’t conducive to growing cacao plants, they found a way to produce chocolate all the same. It’s also the Swiss who can claim the most chocolate consumption per capita – the average Swiss eats more than 10 kilos of chocolate per year!</p>

                <h3>United States</h3>
                <p class="padding"> Our own country is the world’s biggest producer of chocolate. One thing that sets American chocolate apart? The frequent use of peanuts and almonds. There are a number of artisan chocolate shops across the country, but Hershey’s in the country’s largest producer of the candy. And of course, there’s Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a popular family destination for both thrill rides and all the chocolate and confections one can handle!</p>
